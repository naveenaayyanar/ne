# NE - High-Security Steganography Suite

NE is a research-grade, defensive steganography toolkit focused on secure embedding of encrypted payloads into images, audio, video, and text.

This repository contains:
- Modular Python backend (core cryptography, stego modules)
- Secure GUI skeleton (PyQt)
- Documentation for secure deployment, EXE build, and forensic use

Important:
- This tool is designed for lawful, ethical use: academic research, digital forensics, and secure data protection.
- Do NOT use the tool for evading law enforcement or malicious purposes.

Security highlights:
- AES-256-GCM authenticated encryption
- Argon2id password-based key derivation
- Optional RSA key-wrapping for key exchange
- Adaptive randomized embedding and edge-based image embedding
- Secure, encrypted logs and tamper detection

See docs/ for full user and admin documentation.
